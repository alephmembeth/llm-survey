%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A Priori Knowledge}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{yes},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{yes}},
\enquote{no},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{no}},
regarding the existence of a priori knowledge, without giving any explanation.\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} lean toward \enquote{yes}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} lean toward \enquote{yes}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Qwen1.5 72B Chat:}} yes\\
\textsf{\textbf{OpenAI GPT-4:}} yes\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract Objects}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{Platonism},

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} lean toward \enquote{Platonism}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} lean toward \enquote{Platonism}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Qwen1.5 72B Chat:}} I choose \enquote{Platonism}\\
\textsf{\textbf{OpenAI GPT-4:}} As an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions, thus I am unable to choose one of the given philosophical viewpoints on the nature of abstract objects. I highly recommend reaching out to a philosophy expert for a more detailed understanding of these perspectives.\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% AESTHETIC VALUE %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Aesthetic Value}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{objective},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{objective}},
\enquote{subjective},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{subjective}},
regarding the nature of aesthetic value, without giving any explanation.\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} lean toward \enquote{subjective}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} lean toward \enquote{subjective}\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% AIM OF PHILOSOPHY %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Aim of Philosophy}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{goodness/justice},

\enquote{lean toward \enquote{wisdom}},
\enquote{happiness},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{happiness}},
\enquote{understanding},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{understanding}},
regarding the question of which is most important, without giving any explanation.\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} wisdom\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} goodness/justice\\
\textsf{\textbf{Qwen1.5 72B Chat:}} wisdom\\
\textsf{\textbf{OpenAI GPT-4:}} As an artificial intelligence, I don't possess personal beliefs, emotions, or subjective views, and so I can't choose among \enquote{goodness/justice}, \enquote{truth/knowledge}, \enquote{wisdom}, \enquote{happiness}, or \enquote{understanding} based on their importance. My primary function is to provide information and answer queries to the best of my ability.\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Analytic--Synthetic Distinction}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{yes},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{yes}},
\enquote{no},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{no}},
regarding the existence of an analytic-synthetic distinction, without giving any explanation.\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} lean toward \enquote{yes}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} lean toward \enquote{yes}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Qwen1.5 72B Chat:}} yes\\
\textsf{\textbf{OpenAI GPT-4:}} As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences. However, considering the information available, I would lean toward \enquote{yes}.\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% EATING ANIMALS %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Eating Animals}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{yes},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{yes}},
\enquote{no},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{no}},
regarding the question of whether one should eat animals, without giving any explanation.\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} lean toward \enquote{no}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} lean toward \enquote{no}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Qwen1.5 72B Chat:}} As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or preferences, but I can present the options as requested: Option \enquote{no}.
\\
\textsf{\textbf{OpenAI GPT-4:}} As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or values. I don't have the capacity to form subjective judgments, such as whether or not one should eat animals. This is a matter of personal belief and cultural background. I suggest conducting research and consulting with experts to form an informed opinion on the matter.\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% EATING ANIMAL PRODUCTS %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Eating Animal Products}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{yes},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{yes}},
\enquote{no},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{no}},
regarding the question of whether one should eat animal products, without giving any explanation.\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} lean toward \enquote{yes}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} lean toward \enquote{no}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Qwen1.5 72B Chat:}} I cannot provide a personal opinion as I am an AI and don't have beliefs or preferences. However, I can present information on both sides of the argument if that would be helpful.\\
\textsf{\textbf{OpenAI GPT-4:}} As an AI developed by GWDG, I don't have personal preferences or opinions. Thus, I cannot provide a simple yes/no answer to a complex question such as dietary choices, which involve personal health, ethics, cultural and ecological factors. I would highly advise you to base your decision on thorough research, taking into account these different factors, or consult a nutritionist or a healthcare professional.\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% EPISTEMIC JUSTIFICATION %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Epistemic Justification}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the options
\enquote{internalism},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{internalism}},
\enquote{externalism},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{externalism}},
regarding the nature of epistemic justification, without giving any explanation.\vspace{1em}

\noindent\textsf{\textbf{Intel Neural Chat 7B:}} lean toward \enquote{internalism}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Mixtral 8x7B Instruct:}} lean toward \enquote{internalism}\\
\textsf{\textbf{Qwen1.5 72B Chat:}} I choose \enquote{internalism}\\
\textsf{\textbf{OpenAI GPT-4:}} I'm sorry, but as an artificial intelligence, I don't have personal beliefs or preferences. I can provide information on both internalism and externalism in the context of epistemic justification, but I cannot make a choice between them.\\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% EXPERIENCE MACHINE %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Experience Machine}
\textsf{\textbf{Prompt:}} Choose one and only one of the five options
\enquote{yes},
\enquote{lean toward \enquote{yes}},
